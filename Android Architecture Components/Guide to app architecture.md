## Mobile app user experiences
Android apps, on the other hand, have a much more complex structure. A typical Android app contains multiple [app components](), including [activities](), [fragments](), [services](), [content providers](), and [broadcast receivers]().

You declare most of these app components in your [app manifest](). The Android OS then uses this file to decide how to integrate your app into the device's overall user experience. Given that a properly-written Android app contains multiple components and that users often interact with multiple apps in a short period of time, apps need to adapt to different kinds of user-driven workflows and tasks.
